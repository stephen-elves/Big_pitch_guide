        <description><![CDATA[http://www.caravanclub.co.uk/caravanclubapps/applications/uk-caravan-sites-and-parks/SiteDetails.aspx?csid=21816<br><br>Follow CClub route into site, do not enter Dean Lane from A23, you will not get through.<br><br><br>DO NOT TURN UP DEAN LANE<br>If coming via the M25 this is the first turning you will come to after the M23 ends and is where your satnav will try to take you.<br>Instead turn around when you can and take the A23 towards Redhill, shortly after the M23 junction you will see Shepherds Hill on your left, take this road.<br><br>There is a length limit of 10.4m (34ft) it is a roomy site with good facilities and very useful for getting into London by local stations, you will need transport to reach these stations , also Redhill and Reigate close by . Nearest pub on A23, about 15 minute walk.<br><br><br>2nd review 5th wheel owner<br>August 2014.  Very pleasant caravan club site with details and prices as per attached link.  If not a member of the CC could be worth joining as it saves £10p/n for an annual subscription of £40.<br><br>Couple of miles from J7 of the M25 so could be a good stop off point from the North for Portsmouth ferries.<br><br>Access is no problem, but ensure you put Shepherds Hill, Redhill into sat nav and follow that to the top end of Dean Lane.  Site access is about 100 yards from the junction.  If you attempt to negotiate Dean Lane from the A23 you will get stuck (as did a small caravan last night!).  The site directions state to follow A23 to first roundabout and head back in same direction, but if roads not busy you can turn by the Costa Coffee on the right which saves a couple of miles.<br><br>Almost all pitches are hard standing and level with just a handful on grass and slope.  Two supersize pitches opposite washing facilities (58 & 59) allow very easy access but there are also many other large and well spaced pitches.  Normally Caravan Club sites are a question of finding a vacant pitch on arrival and let them know which, but when we booked and explained our size and inexperience they reserved a supersize for us. Staff very pleasant and helpful.<br><br>Shower blocks excellent and cleaned daily.  Two wash/shower/laundry blocks.  Free showers.  Washing machine £3.00, driers 70p.<br><br>Wifi now of a good standard (upgraded this week) charged at £2.50 per day, £10.00 per week or £25 per year.  Many wifi repeaters throughout the site.  Lots of trees on site which may interfere with satellite, although DTV has excellent reception.<br><br>Basic shop in reception area (milk, papers etc).  Bus stop into town near reception.  Dogs welcome and large dog walking trail from entrance.  Two small play areas for children.<br><br>Would certainly revisit.]]></description>

Very 5er friendly, site owner's father has a seasonal 5er on site plus two other seasonal ones so fully conversant and welcoming.  Access very easy from main Abergavenny to Hereford road.  From the short dual carriageway stretch turn right, then left at T junction. Pass the hospital on your right, pass the first turn on right and take second turn on right.  Signs for fruit fair.<br><br>Pitches have a great view over the surrounding countryside, with pear trees separating each one and an orchard to the back of it. <br><br>Pitch 7A is a dream to get onto, so well worth asking for.  Owner has been asked to make it a seasonal pitch due to views but keeps it for bigger units.  It's an end of row that can be driven onto with only a few shunts.  Go round the end corner and take a wide swing and a couple of straighten ups will see you set up.  Slight incline on this one but nothing major.<br><br>Water points and EHU just a few steps away on most pitches. <br><br>Electric is metered by a top up card, with a refund for any unused balance.<br><br>Laundry: £1.00 for 15 mins drying time.

Maybe worth checking if it is important to you.<br>Site is set up on the assumption that you are totally self sufficient.

No shop or bar but in the day you can go into the hall for tea and cake I think, oh and a tour of the hall and gardens!!]]></description>

We can highly recomend it to our fellow 5er owners. Good access roads, plenty of room on site. The website says a limit of 9m but i rang the site first to advise them of our trailer length and they said no problem. Reserved a pitch for us to make sure we had one big enough but there were plenty of pitches that would have been ok.<br>Great area for walking and cycling and mostly off road. Good pubs and plenty of interesting places to visit. Well worth a look if you are a CC member. We will go again.]]></description>

It was a bit tight lining up to access the barrier as you had to  tap in a code after registering. Pitches were a bit narrow and we struggled to park our pick up next to the van and open the doors. The site is grass with paved roads and  some hardstanding pitches – the grassy areas were very soggy in wet conditions. Great picturesque location next to the Thames. Site can flood in extreme weather as we found out!<br><br>Services<br><br>Electric, water and drainage to a choice of pitch sizes, depending on what you want. Large ablutions block, heated and very well equipped. Site is well served for buses and trains into London.<br><br>Overview<br><br>Good site and would return – we were only there a few days before we had to move as the Thames flooded the site.

        <description><![CDATA[5th wheel friendly...........Ended up at this site because we couldn't find the one we were booked to go to. We just drove in and asked if they could fit us in (remember it is May). Friendly warden said they could. Virtually picked our own pitch. Warden just suggested area of site. Ended up reasonably close to the facilities which are very good. Some people complain about these showers on other web sites. I think they should get a life. Yes, the showers have to be paid for (but see ACSI below), and yes you have to push the button for 15 seconds of water. Apart from that they are extremely clean and a good size and enough of them. You also get piped music every time you enter the building. We thought they were very good. Also Laundry & washing up facilities.<br><br>This site accepts ACSI cards. Included in this price is EHU and a shower token per person per day. AS for the price itself: the book price was £24/night, but with the ACSI card this is 16euro/night and we actually paid £12/night.<br><br>Water / grey waste & chemical disposal all reasonable. Wifi available.<br><br>A club house and bar are in the process of being built, but not completed at our visit. However, there is a fabulous pub/restaurant only a 0.8mile walk away. There is pavement all the way. Only bad point is that it is a sloping walk down to the pub which means it is a sloping (not severe) walk back up to the site.<br><br>There seemed to be quite a few seasonal caravans/motorhomes/and 5vers on the site. Also during our stay there seemed to be a number of pitches taken up by workers during the week who went home at the weekend (done that myself in the past).<br><br>Good position for visiting local attractions.]]></description>

(This site is best suited to us lightweight shorter RVs I would suggest that <30' MAX and with and overall height of less than 11'6''.

(just got under the 11'6" bridge just before the entrance and fit on the hard standing with a little overhang) Steam Engine Station 200m walk from site and the trains pass by the site on an embankment in clear view. 200m further on and there is a canal side Pub (very popular) and level shale towpath. Following this towpath for 1/2 mile ( or back up the lane you drove down to the site as they end up at the same place) is smart looking canalside/lockside Bistro Restaurant. 3 miles into Leek, very old market town not city like, and on the edge of the Staffordshire moorlands, Roaches<br> <br>Try to pick a weekend when the steam trains are running or there is a special Gala Event (I'm not really a steam buff but enjoyed it as something a little different )<br> <br>http://www.churnet-valley-railway.co.uk/<br> <br>This is 200m walk from the site. The trains go all day (not cheap at £70 family ticket (£24 adult)) but is a day rover up and down through Staffs Moorlands) Steam up and whistles from 7am along with sights, sounds, and smells from the steam era. Lots of people and cameras, opportunities to drive a steam train in the sidings for a fiver. look through the workshop and sidings, all sorts of train memorabilia and odd people in boiler suits.<br> <br>Canal side walking for miles]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Access<br><br>Good access, about 10 minutes from the M40 – there are 2 ways to get to the farm – both quite narrow in places with some blind corners – take it slow.  Access into pitches was a little tight as the grass was wet. Good draining soil, so no problems reversing the trailer in across the grass.<br><br>Services<br><br>Electric on each pitch but water at standpipes. Unless you have a long hosepipe or are close to a standpipe all water and waste is toted.  There was a facility to dump grey water in a manhole in the road, all black and chemical waste has to be lifted and emptied into a flushable sink.  There are on site showers and general ablutions, but there is a charge for a shower. Small shop with essentials and bottled gas. Fresh eggs available as there is a chicken farm next door.   Children’s play area.<br><br>Overview<br><br>Handy site for London and the local area. Local shops a short drive away. On bus route and rail stations are very close by.<br><br>Note - when we arrived, we were told that they were considering ‘banning’ all big American rigs – make it clear if you have a 5ver or big RV.<br><br>Highclere Farm Country Touring Park<br>Seer Green, Buckinghamshire<br><br>highclerefarmpark.co.uk (http://www.highclerefarmpark.co.uk/)]]></description>

The toilets / facility block was clean and tidy and very warm for the summer that we are currently having. Nico's the restaurant / bar had some type of entertainment on most night and the food served was good.<br>The road around the caravan park is a one way system and they are very narrow which makes reversing onto your pitch a bit difficult. You do get the option of picking your pitch on the day of arrival or you can pre book. As the whole site is on a slope be careful if it has rained and the ground is wet you might end up crossing the grass!<br>The site has increased the number of fully serviced pitches with grey water disposal but the signal from the aerial point was not very good. Will certainly be going back latter in the year.<br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK26PW6c4X3Tvp0tL7KrEElHTrr8UIT1SefIR51Eer1murVXEhoeAvfrysrX3L9t-macb7psDZH86yKXmJeRx2ggsWHQJYD_xl6-uSO3LHdWVSDdaVEfE2ROv2Qb3g9s7b9q1bvkmGOrw75uygDvO6w5AkaVUeQPpJewLAx1ogharSd70yCyNUo11YIgYl6eLyItsDSDfnUkvUJ6jkHQMrHZueMSp60cBf1le1ZkdUTB3wxHYKgvNDVBaaRygLAUhY1PqyZS8C3mzcr3ncBJx3cgi3GMqrkykOtRpjhQ" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

Hard standing tarmac area, each pitch with own, electric, water and waste.<br>Large club (probably chaos in main season) and shop stocking essentials and some spares. Tescos and pub walkable for the fitter amongst us.<br><br>Plenty of toilets and showers, but get there early, or use your own as fully serviced pitch.<br><br>On site health club that allows pay as you go, spa, gym, or pool.<br>Book three consecutive nights and get a free swim pass for every day you stay. Tried the pool out, really quiet as we were the only ones in and it was as warm as a bath<br><br>Maybe one to consider as it would make a great stopover while passing down the M5 or maybe a first time out site as really easy run on good roads, easy access through the gates, (they open the exit and escort wrong way around one way to make easier) large area to park ( no maneuvering on to a pitch) and fully serviced.<br><br>Downside, well being close to the main roads it's not quiet, and toilets could be better,<br><br>One to try, site with pool....we would go back]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[http://www.jtwcoxfarms.co.uk/camping.html       (http://www.jtwcoxfarms.co.uk/camping.html      ) Its a good site (well suits me anyway) about 3 or 4 miles outside Oxford at Beckley (the oxford park and ride is not too far I think). Its a working farm, but coming from a farming background that doesn't bother me. No formally laid out pitches and all grass, but though its wet I think the undersurface is very firm and if you did get stuck they would give you a tow. I am not brave enough and have stayed with one back wheel on the service road.<br><br>Only one other tourer on the site, which is sloping but when the weather clears has spectacular views out over Oxfordshire. Behind us on the other side of the service road are quite a few what seem to be more permanent caravans, but everyone is very quiet, and you rarely see many folk<br><br>The RSPB has a base here, so it must be good for bird spotting and a pair of Red Kites patrol the site quite often, there is a small wood next door and I think you can go where you like round the farm if you are sensible (I have had to stay in)<br><br>Fresh Chicken and Duck eggs from onsite orchard flock<br><br>Very friendly helpful hosts, and only £10 an night including hookup, nice and easy emptying and filling as well - the facility block is a bit basic, but I always use my onboard anyway - except at Inver where they have a wonderful heated block with fantastic power showers each in an individual large bathroom]]></description>

Facilities maybe not as good as CC sites but nonetheless, perfectly adequate.<br>There is also a large clubhouse and play areas for the kids. <br>No dedicated dog walk but with the beach only 10 mins away there’s really no need. Don’t forget the poo bags!<br>The pitches are all level and on gravel. With the site being so flat, it does have a tendency to flood a little during/after very wet weather, so don’t forget the wellies if going in the rainy season, which in the UK is January to December!<br>For the life of me I can’t remember if there’s a dedicated RV dump point, so hopefully someone can let us know in the review box below if they do, or don’t.

And do not access from drayton manor end of the road as the bridge is not the easiest, from kingsbury its a easy run in.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[We have just returned from a great weekend away at the site above, the camp site has well kept pitches which are spacious and have electric hook up. Some are secluded with box hedges and some are open plan as prefered, all are flat but sadly no hard standings so best used during dry weather only. The site has three nice sized fields with clean well kept toilet, shower, laundry blocks (one pre field). It has a nice sized in door free heated pool and a small bar/ resturant, a nice kids play area and very extensive dog walks, shopping and post office is in the village which is just 500yrds up the lane and has a regular bus route to Helston and Redruth. The site is very well kept with extensive views over Carn Brea and towards Helston, Good RV disposal point and although this is a family site it was not intrusive.<br>Prices for two adults and one child was mid season £21.00 per night with free awning and free use of pool, staff are very helpful. 8/10 and would have been higher if it had hard standings. Located in the village of Four Lanes above the town of Redruth the campsite can be approached from both Helston or Redruth, but from Helston the main road gets narrow in places and the Redruth route below is reconmended.<br><br>Travel westbound on the A30 take the SECOND slip road exit for Redruth as the first takes you under a low bridge our RV will go under it but best taking the second exit.<br>So up the second slip road on the main A30 for Redruth then turn left back along the old A30 back the way you came. Stay left at the first mini roundabout on to the next larger roundabout the take the second exit ( right ) towards Redruth, at the top of the hill take the left at the mini roundabout along Sandy Lane, at the next mini (double) roundabout carry on over and up Sandy lane do not turn off here left or right !!! after a mile you will come to another mini roundabout, (Falmouth Road) turn right back towards Redruth, (these are all wide roads and sellected to miss Redruth town centre and the railway bridge.) As you come down the hill turn left at the traffic lights and carry on up the long hill to Four lanes village. Through the village past the cross roads ( pub on left, post office on right) carry on until the next small junction on the right. Turn right here down the lane if cars are parked in the lane worry not a wide RV will pass with care, 500 yards the lane opens out and the wide campsite entrance is on your left. FOLLOW THE RECEPTION CHECK IN SIGNS and park in the check in parking bay, this is so you can use the wider entrance to the camping fields as the first fields entrance is very tight, plus on the wider field entrance you will see the RV waste facility on the left.]]></description>

Err…no as it turned out… <br>All relevant measurements as requested were supplied for the booking…apart from width!  What…?!  Yup, site bod said we should have mentioned width when we booked as we are much wider than normal rig when slide is out…hmmm…no mention of all the humungous awnings on twin axle caravans, which made their rigs twice our width!! Pfft – width indeed…!<br>Next issue was how to get us in…normal entrance had “two 90 degree turns in the road, no way you’ll make it that way mate” said bod…he obviously didn’t know anything about a Sidewinder…but, as bod had had his feathers ruffled already by our width, we didn’t argue and went in the ‘back door’ – dead easy with no obstacles…just a lot of caravans and motorhomes parked on a large lawn watching us go by…we ended up at the bottom of the site where Andrew reversed easily onto a very large pitch…keeping “to the right of the white peg please” – the only downside was that we were bordered by very big trees on 2 sides which meant we didn’t see much of the sun in the afternoon – lots in the morning though which was lovely… Site bod was only trying to be helpful I guess, but only succeeded in coming across as bossy!  All that aside, the site was immaculate and quite pretty – we were lucky in that we didn’t have any noise from the traffic on the main road too…<br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK26PW6xBKvuusxzZMacPBLXw8krGDE1FirPmRUfYE01ztwGQmHHQpjNluvCronnHkrp3kTUmGysJea9gNLw0JkDMwii0FPou-0Imh3D6IszHuok-p7T2IQReRVuyvbcvj-Tf2ECYxaZwNNfePU3kLl7f5dKiPERZAcKEP2iT_YzK6JF3kTAO2eRHzBe0NIqYRvHiSz201WXT6UH4DwjuBt2u4sG_c670RJsqFBRvZu7nqPczjaCIWeVN3DNnYLfjBb9nGI7yW9x-tcLJBDstPl0eJ18198" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[update 08/03/15 RV friendly  real easy ride just of the A52 Derby to Ashbourne road (Derby side), with great access, real friendly and helpful owners too. All topped off with glorious sunny weather.<br><br>The large site is well laid out with a mix of mobile home, seasonal tourers , caravan and Motorhome pitches along with grassed area for tents. Most have 10A EHU. The roads were tarmac or very hard stone, wide roads with even wider corners without boulder markers and the pitches were massive, (ours, pitch 113, must have been 40'+ hard standing with great countryside views ) and there were plenty that the largest RVs would fit on with plenty of room to maneover into position.<br><br>The site was quiet this weekend, but do get the feeling it's a active site during the summer, archery, grass buggies, play parks family room pub, cafe on site etc<br><br>Best of all its a 25minute stroll into Ashbourne or they run a free shuttle bus back and forth. There is a little corner shop, 10 mins walk for bread, milk etc and the whole site is criss crossed with public footpaths<br><br>At £27/night for EHU only (no water or waste on the pitch) not cheap but then neither was Bogwell. There is no way to dump without a macerator, but I'm sure the owners would help with a manhole cover, we just did not have the time.<br><br>Give it a go, one for the kids<br><br>And for the record, the toilets / showers were spotless<br><br>http://www.peakgateway.com/]]></description>

        <description>RV friendly........great friendly park,  I have been going there with my ARV Forest River Georgtown for a few years now, book ahead as it is popular, Warden and his good Lady are very friendly, There is an award winning chip shop 200yrds into Tyndrum on the left and a pub a further 100 yards on the right called Tyndrum Inn, also the Green Welly Truck stop sells everything. not forgetting the little corner shop Brodies for the stuff you need to replenish like bread and milk.</description>

If you book direct with the site they are aware what a 5th wheel is and reserved a special plot, No 17 which is a fully serviced pitch and easy to get into, only downside with this pitch is that you have a lamppost at the front and the rear of the pitch, giving you light all night long.<br><br>Toilets and showers very good and Reception also acts as a small shop.<br><br>At night the site is very quite.<br><br>The last 1.5 miles into the site is by a very narrow winding road with passing places. Take this run in slowly and carefully and allow oncoming vehicles to pass and you should not have any trouble.]]></description>

The site has a pub and pizzeria on site, along with indoor swimming pool, hairdressers and much more. The entrance is large and the site is easy to access, as we did in our 40foot Monaco Diplomat.<br>There were lots of walks in the forest and a very nice pub less than a mile down the road where we had lunch with friends and watched the New forest ponies wandering free.<br>The site is quite expensive and is very popular with families with children.

We booked the XL pitch with electric and had plenty of space to ourselves (some of the caravanners did seem a little squashed into the smaller pitches).<br><br>There are no toilets or showers on site, which means very few tents around.  Access into the site and onto the pitch was fine.  Very friendly staff.  Water and waste dump points available to drive up to all around the site.<br><br>the dump points are located around the site and are easy to pull up to.  They consist of an enclosed drain area with a standard size sewer pipe to take grey and black.  There is a small lip around the waste drain, so a little lift at the conclusion is needed to make sure it all gets out.  There is also a tap/hose to clean the pipes out afterwards.  Drinking water is sourced from a separate tap adjacent to the dump.<br><br>As for a forty footer - I am not sure.  I reckon you could get on the pitch I was on (pitch 21) by sticking your backside into the clearing in the forest behind the pitch.  However, on the website booking page it will only accept up to 33ft automatically.  I think a call and chat to the warden would clarify.  I am unable to say for sure about the access roads.  I did not have a problem, but I am only 32ft.<br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK26PW6AIjVMeWaTHj5bnLi2h_7S1AsrXPWLofNSnh0Pr3H7owF30IF92GY3R7boMgx9GWLz4l3DYxb5sIDImv07shZRxAe0xGs6ZgAmEwMFxD3RbsAFFp-b0iAvsTPCizVESMLz-0x5EsaywChhqP18E40djZngpOxamHqtnXuUW6c86cFzySslAl15-lxXdxPuszpOpXmLhDZH3zibnw" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK26PW5C5ssT_Uumi_a56k-F1BacEXBu5MlRcOnOpyUmEfeKThOqhrH04dQpaj3Y5e7_NN27fUOX_tbK8BMltJDGFWnOlgMxorpPH-4FNXabZd6543JD9JbR8r5oUUGHaaXcEgNPl_eW7FeRGR9E5u_bY01bznRHAGbJpa1kOz2GoInYmOze30ixb3Pyf9P1Io57BfHqvNAQ5cr3PXwKVtXuHZ7WAxj93A9lOnJxqP0f8BvhbFIfkayIzgGQ-8A4gTEP_uze5pPzn3hGY-SOHZ_iL_HUA36MNIqwKOg0IeB_JspXUaIfrF5tpMpFzGJhe-X97poDTJbZYiX_KSaghecysZUcNF5g5x9-Ag8" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK26PW5cu0JKm3wwN-K6QM6q8T9TmP8e0-EvgmcrHhNkYf08EwVaUmaUulqHaLnN5QLyFJ3TgMVH-gXWTHFkhFyEj_7OwKzZ8v9Y_yYbQTFhASpk6XcdH5fuckxKMPDWAgP_jyKzEgh1pSBTKBeaCvFLelO-xbd175iO0Ed8-qPxtw7b8SlIkBk3AbUs3Xae97z5Bom9QjWoJF2nsuoH0ebYPfuRGZa8J108hxSqCNQk6RFv9eKrFD8AFHry9fE8SsfPQQYFgOnUARHR5ki9-7ZJ-8Y8xz2V8p9jjK4QgK03k148UNoQg1K7rcasZpP2-_sXGtSp1GwJCaePAQPrEM6hrPSe9PMhEokgvOwV-g" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

If you go to the Ironbridge Museum, your entrance ticket is a 12 month passport and you can visit as many times as you like during that time.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[5th wheel friendly....WHAT A GREAT SITE. We loved it here.<br><br>All pitches enormously wide. We were put on a pitch that it was thought we would need to be on because of our size but in truth we would have fitted length ways on most of them.<br>Access lane looks difficult on Google but the trees were high enough not to cause any problems and it is not that narrow.<br><br>Swimming pool - shop - bar restaurant (not open during the week of our stay & we were not there at the weekend when it would have been open). Wifi available. Staff extremely helpful and friendly.<br><br>Shower facilities are very good. Piped radio music on entry. 5 showers, 6 loos, wash basins, disabled room & hair dryers in both the mens and womens. Free use of shower.<br><br>Drives between rows of pitches not the widest and some fencing that may cause turning issues if the site is very busy.<br><br>Plenty of water/grey waste disposal, and EHU seemed to be on most pitches.<br><br>Pub/restaurant within 15 minute walk (even for us oldies) of the site. Good position for coast or New Forest.<br><br>ACSI card site. Booking price for May was £30/night. We paid an ACSI price of 16 euro, £14/night]]></description>

Short distance (apparently about 20 mins) from the ferry terminals. Access roads to site are fine from the M27 (no low bridges or width restrictions). We were advised to enter via the exit gate as the swing area by reception is a tad tight. Ensure you go onto opposite carriage before swinging in to get best angle. When you pass pick your own fruit on Grange Road be on lookout for site as it is shortly afterwards. Pass the entrance on left and exit is shortly after.<br><br>All pitches level as is the whole site. Well maintained grass. Centre pitches grass and outer pitches hard standing. Several very long narrow hard standing pitches which just means parking in front of van (plenty of room). All pitches have EHU and individual water tap. Walking distance to several pubs (The cottage is our pub of choice!) and large Tesco a short drive away. Small shop in reception area.<br><br>Showers free of charge (Push button 15 seconds). Hair drier in ladies (apparently!). One toilet block which is sufficient for size of site. Clean and well maintained. Washing machines £3.50 and driers £1.00. Free microwave, iron and board and freezer in utilities room. Separate sinks for washing up and clothes hand washing. Book swap also located in here. No wi fi on site. Slight downside is that the Elsan point is raised (toilet height in separate area) so either small totes or empty before full.<br><br>Wardens very friendly and helpful, with two residing in a Denali 5th wheel by the exit who are experienced 5th wheelers. (have been given a leaflet and may be joining forum soon!). <br><br>Would definitely visit again.]]></description>

Managers are RVers, up to 34ft not usually a problem, depends on numbers as always, though on size chap said ring as they may be able to squeeze a little more length just depends on availability. Many pitches are full service, water and a bayonet type dump conection, I'm going to investigate this later as to yank or euro size, this is black and grey. There doesn't appear to be an extra charge for this. All hard standing though all seem a little off level. On auto we had rear wheels dangling, so I released and set manually, levelled fine with wheels on ground. Kids fine, few here but not heard them, wouldn't fancy the kiddy holiday season, and apparently the regatta is not much fun, 24hr security drafted in, another one to miss. No dogs in the kiddy hols either but fine the rest of the season. We like it, pretty quiet, 10 minute walk into Henley, we're already planning a return or two. If the sun is out you can enjoy all day on most pitches with little more than a shuffle.]]></description>

        <name>Teversal Camping and Caravanning Club Site</name>
        <description><![CDATA[Teversal Camping and Caravanning Club Site<br>Silverhill Lane<br>Teversal, Nottinghamshire NG17 3JJ<br>01623 551838<br>campingandcaravanningclub (http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/campsites/uk/nottinghamshire/teversal/teversal)<br><br>This is a franchise site and it is 100% Fifth Wheel friendly.  We're here at the moment and this couldn't have been easier for our very first trip in a Fifth Wheel.<br><br>Chris and Jayne Woods are the owners.  We had originally booked in with our trailer tent but after our impulse buy on our Celtic Rambler we phoned to see if they could accommodate us. No problem. In fact they could cope with up to 10 large rigs although some of the pitches would require a bit of manoeuvring. But that's no problem with Chris.  He guided me to a pitch and actually gave me left hand/right hand down instructions and without me even looking in my mirrors he got me inch perfect on to the pitch.<br><br>Another big plus is that they've recently installed a full motorhome service point including black water dump.  Really easy to drive over so will be using that when we leave to get everything emptied.<br><br>They've recently built a new toilet block which is by far the best I've ever seen on any site anywhere.  The showers are full blown wet rooms with toilet and basin in them, plenty of room, very well tiled etc. And kept immaculately clean.  There is only one downside and that is that the showers are the new fangled automatic ones that you wave your hand over a sensor to activate.  They have an initial blast of very hot water followed by an all too short duration of tolerable temperature.  I spoke to Jayne about it and it's all to do with legionella. They're working with the manufacturer to see if they can extend the period that the shower runs for after the initial too hot blast.<br><br>One other noteworthy point is that they already had their own commercial wifi running before the club rolled theirs out.  So firstly, if you have an annual pass from a mainstream club site it won't work here. And secondly, once you have logged in with one device that's it, you can't log that one out and log another one in.  I've installed an iBoost wifi system from Motorhome Wifi and because I'd already used the site wifi pass with my iPad, I couldn't then allocate that user ID and password to the iBoost.  So I've ended up buying a second pass for the iBoost but Jayne is going to give me the second week free.<br><br>Access to the site is easy with any sized rig.  Very generous access road and reception area.<br><br>So apart from the two minor niggles mentioned, I really can't recommend this site highly enough.]]></description>

Easy access flat and level and the owners have just turned one of the 5 hard standing pitches into an RV pitch, the other 4 are suitable for 30'+ with the overhang on the grass. There is plenty of room you could get a 40' RV towing a trailer into the site and rally fields. May involve a final easy reverse onto the pitch but wide open with no obstructions. Bus stop easy stroll away into Holbeach, Spalding or kings Lynn, 10 minutes stroll to 500 seat cafe and farm shop, or 3 miles to Holbeach really easy cycling. Low level black dump but need 10' hose, we were asked to dump all grey water into the newly planted hedgerows and tree lines. Watch the hares on the field, bats, birds dragonflies wildlife, or the Tornados overhead practicing their manoeuvres. A proper dog walk with bins and water bowls along the way. <br><br>They also have 5 grass rally fields, they are well drained and solid, the field we were in would take 12 RVs but the larger field would easily accommodate 100+. Water points all over the site with plenty of 16A electric HU, and if you want to park where there is no electric, no problem they will lend you, FOC, a 50m steel wired (http://www.amazon.co.uk/-/dp/B009L2VG2E) armoured cable. Can organise hog roasts, or catering for many along with a fish and chip restaurant. (Yep restaurant, double decker bus chip van so seating for all)<br><br>They have spend money stocking the fishing lake, on plants shrubs and trees to screen the fields installing electric and water all over the fields, and are actively looking for groups to rally with them. They would love to see some RVs so if anyone is feeling brave and fancies organising a rally. <br><br><br> The owners could not be more helpful and welcomed us even taking the time to walk around the site a check that everyone was OK and if there was anything else that could be done to make the stay more pleasurable. <br><br>The only downside, well there is currently only one toilet and shower, although they have planning permission for a new amenity block, ( showers toilets, laundry, cafe, shop, reception,) and the footings are going in from September along with the new 3acre fishing lake. So in the meantime if you are prepared to use your own facilities this site is brilliant.]]></description>

        <description>5th wheel /RV friendly Very good campground. Near the A1 but no noise, narrow lane as you get to the entrance but no trees and room to pull over, very good for room to back-up and good size pitches all on level hard standing. EHU and water near by. 5star drive over dump station. The owners are very friendly and used to having 5ers pull in. A very relaxing site with plenty of room to enjoy the weekend. Downtown Shopping Center which is just a couple of mins away.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[Just spent a couple of weeks at Wareham Forest Touest Park in Dorset. Was booked on one of the Superior Pitches which has water, electricity, grey water drainage and a TV point. The whole park is set in within trees and well maintained. The toilet / shower block was very clean and warm and in the same block where the washing machines and dryers with a separate room for dish washing. The outside swimming pool was not open but was due to open in the beginning of June.<br>Entrance onto and off the park was very easy and the way into the pitches was controlled by a barrier.<br>Woke up one morning to find a couple of dear eating the hedge. Most mornings the 'dawn chorus' would wake you up. One small problem is that Bovington Tank camp is relatively close and one night you could hear the tanks on exercise until midnight.<br><br>http://www.warehamforest.co.uk/]]></description>

For the children there is a large play and games area adjoining fields for those with pets.<br>http://www.widemouthbaytouring.co.uk/<br><br>Site is very easy to get to and is RV friendly (two other RV's on site as well as me) pitches are mostly level and all hard standing with hook up hard standings are about 33ft long and 14ft wide, some larger super pitches with main water and drainage are also available. Located 5 mile from Bude on the main "atlantic highway" A39 and only 2 miles from Widemouth Bay beaches and surfing. Look for Widemouth Fields signs and flags on large layby. <br>The entrance is in the layby on the left driving from Bude or on right coming from the Camelford direction. The entrance is wide as is one way system roads on the site. DO NOT go into Bude Medows site which is in the same layby as they do not have pitches longer than 20 ft the sites roads are narrow and it cannot take RV's. ( we went for a walk around it to check )  <br>Wide Mouth Fields has not been open that long so has not got landscaped tree lined garden pitches but it has unspoilt views of Cornish and Devon countryside and hills to the North, Small shop, laundry, small cafe/bar, good child outdoor play area, nice toilet blocks x2, free regular mini bus to Bude and Widemouth Bay. Take a wheely waste water container if not using super pitches as it has no dumping facilities other than normal caravan type cassette draining. Prices are resonable and awnings and car are free. my rating 8.5 /10  (good site)<br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK26PW6uYLtVsR43bjUQ1fpXF1DURJzccDUbRXalXwKP2cW_WWUhLsNqd9JNqjtFwbyBu6vXG6P_1Ua3ySVpIkWvyO33a22bYrZGmhEAq0pEzJge9ugxcci1wW7nC-O2tXcplXgQ4ZR1caE_kPnqKiahzqgGnBYcH1H0vrY3LmWWK848KaJ12kF7uuMl" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK26PW4jo6vhS0DlW8kemdDkvAyRzur9SuJdHbjB_vmNbxQ_u70UaAHn_kvp8x0g21GpfLSjQNzcGyJCrCJZ3vYheTmwdzBVesxyidbBpSKvuNz0zlQO-B5EatkGXojAS7B9IHBVGgT-0n4CB9bLfMZRky3US4iecgKlsiDepIyxTegFWtF1kUvLh5Ba4XwAvSIgpIxU_Pjqqqu3uyYevCKsIthjTiDPyyoMTgNE9cgI_HRZIQHxQ4NCwEc" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK26PW4ye835R668evJ0pPNEm-ANW5pYLEgp2D4uIyzD25HnZvRtYAspN37OtzEZhWLAho-6C6z2KZ4oXHfBBLlBdxjIA2ORz5BSFzff8JyIf_WzPZ8rXhk_m-ipTfFIik5bpR7P4Wsd6aamqplZx8701hJNB0otjlvUUKAJNPDFrQzK3krMA64hw0vEOS5coxsgBUDcu1iuDC2iKf5VxRQ5IcGRfAM3CKUvVkVG4KeFIe6w2LfqPkW2a7W4LVeE-g5jBDPbee9nZkynSWaV_bGatIKcohbevlwhaK81" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

It is looking tired and they do let comercial vans onto the site plus it would seem that some do live in their touring caravans.

The shower and toilet blocks with underfloor heating are absolutely 6*. Take this from someone who never uses facilities on sites, but I make an exceptions here.<br><br>There is also a club house with two bars and use of the leisure centre sited on the entrance road is available at reduced rates.]]></description>

If you like fishing its excellent, lovely lake with pitches backing onto same. <br>All pitches are very big<br>water ehu and grey on pitch with black water point as you leave. Use pitches 1- 16 as they are older part of site. (we previously went on newer part and jacks sank in so we had to move) No shop on site but bus stop outside site with buses every thirty mins into York.    *May2015 update* This site has to be one of the best i have used. Large hardstanding, level pitches with EHU, water and grey waste all on pitch. Hedges devide the pitches with plenty of grass as well. The owner and staff are all very helpful and friendly. Bus stop at gate for short ride into York.

Excellent food, service and dogs allowed in the bar area(same lovely menu as in the restaurant area).<br>Site manager and staff very friendly and helpful. Will even park the 5th wheel up if you are struggling. Good facilities and also an on site pub with restaurant. Good basic food menu well priced. Also bed and breakfast available. Children's play area.<br>Lovely views across to the sea and easily reached as it's just off the main road from Scarbrough to Whitby.<br>Pre agreed £7 taxi fare into Whitby or bus stop 5 mins walk from the site.<br>Need to ring and let them know it's a 5th wheel so they can choose appropriate pitch as they can be a bit tight when busy.]]></description>

        <description>Rv friendly......Access is only a short drive off the main road Access is OK apart from one small section over a cattle grid near the entrance to the site .. it is a standard size cattle grid  the gap and it is 3m between the stone walls .. it looks narrow on the approach because the walls are built straight up from the edges of the grid. The facilities on the camp ground are basic, but if you are using your own RV shower etc then its fine.....http://www.treborthleisure.co.uk/</description>

We were asked to leave the trailer near reception which was no problem.<br>There are hard standings but no super pitches with drainage, so I would recommend a trundler for waste.

We took our 30ft Georgie Boy when we first bought it to try out.<br>They were most welcoming and we fit easily on the pitch. facilities are superb and they also have a cafe on site. It appeared that lots of caravans had been booked for the season so you should definitely book this one in advance to be sure.<br>Pub in the village has great reputation for food and market town of Pocklington is only 1.5 miles away.]]></description>

Would highly recommend it. Warden Ian is brilliant and he has a sing song nearly every night, Can take up to 40 Foot. 15 mins walk to the Falkirk Wheel, 4 miles to the Kelpies. Amazing.

        <description><![CDATA[I had booked in to this site in Suffolk with our 30 foot Georgie Boy.<br>Having now been I am happy to report this site is superb and can easily cater for the largest of RV’s. The pitch we had was large enough for the RV the trailer and the smart car with room to spare.<br>Access is really easy as long as you approach from Saxmundham. The shower block is superb and it even boasts a bar which opens some nights of the week.<br>A great base to look around Suffolk but you will need transport.<br><br>Please check availability first with the site.<br>A note from the owners: We can accommodate longer units, depending on the shape and exact size. It depends on numerous factors including the side of the door on the unit, whether it is a caravan or motorhome, etc. We have also had 2 seasonal pitches booked for this year that are to accommodate larger units so this has limited our availability for certain busier periods during the year.]]></description>
