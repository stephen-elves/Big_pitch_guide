        <name>Camping Scarabeo</name>
        <description>Rv friendly... It is in Santa Croce Camerina, Punta Braccetto, Ragusa. The campsite is split into two sections with private gardens and house in between. The owner, Angela di Modica, is very friendly and helpful and speaks very good English. She even rang the vet to arrange an appointment for our dog. Both sections of the campsite have paths that lead directly onto the long beach. There are free water taps on the site and free cold showers. Out of season, the private toilets and warm showers are free too. There are ample wash basins and washing-up sinks that are cleaned every day. Wi-fi can be purchased and is then available all over the campsite. I think we paid 8â‚¬ for 20 hours. There is a bar and restaurant at the very end of the beach (a lovely stroll along by the sea) and a a mini-mart a few hundred metres away.</description>

        <name>Il Cicero</name>
        <description><![CDATA[Rv friendly..... This is in northern Sicily and if you cross from the toe of Italy on the short ferry crossing (no booking necessary as it runs about every hour) from there to Messina in Sicily, it is about an hour's drive along that northern Sicilian coast road. The camp is directly over the road from the very, very wide beach that never got packed even in july when we stayed there. There is a lovely pool near the bar area and it has a shallow area for children and a deeper one for adults. There is NO entertainment organised at the camp (thank goodness!) and if you want entertainment, there is a Lido a 100m down the road and children's clubs organised by the nearby town. The town is San Giorgio and reached by an enjoyable stroll along the sea front. It is a pretty town with ample restaurants and shops. Wifi is free but can only be accessed when sitting around the bar area. There is a large and attractive pizza and pasta restaurant that offers other dishes too, right next door and clients of the campsite have a discount on their bills! Lovely owners of the campsite MÃ¨lanie and Andrea Ruffo, are very helpful and they speak relatively good English (speak slowly!) The beach has those palm tree leaf parasols permanently in the ground in a section directly opposite the camp and are free to use and if you are a client of this campsite you have use of deckchairs under the parasols for free.]]></description>

        <name>Costa Ponente</name>
        <description><![CDATA[RV friendly.... near CefalÃ¹. CefalÃ¹ town italef is very interesting. It is a Medieval town and is very quaint with loads of restaurants. It gets very packed but is worth a long exploration as lots of myths and history there.<br>This campsite is about a two hours' drive west along the toll road (stick to the toll road as much as you can as the sea road is VERY winding and narrow in parts) from the Il-Cicero campsite and it is called Costa Ponente and it is immediately next door to another campsite (called Sanfillip, which advertised kiddies' entertainment so we avoided that one!). (Having come off the toll road for CefalÃ¹, you head towards that town but then turn left off the main road at an angle, down a short road to a railway track then head straight over into the entrance of Costa Potente.) It doesn't seem to be well advertised but it is very large and is terraced and you can wander in and select your own pitch - of which there are many and of various sizes. The pitches are all surrounded by trees so there is a good bit of shade no matter what time of day.<br>There is a huge swimming pool though it does close between 12.30 and 4pm which we found strange as everyone is queueing at the gate by 4pm. The pool is surrounded by grass so one can sunbathe on loungers or the grass. There is access to the beach but it is down lots and lots of crumbling concrete steps and the beach and the sea is full of huge stones which are slippery and hurt the feet, making walking into the sea near impossible so people were sitting on their behinds and shuffling into the sea backwards. We gave up after the first time and stuck to the pool!<br>There was a bar and small shop and access to wifi in that area and also a washing machine at 5â‚¬ per load (includes their liquids). Plenty of loo. Nd wash blocks though i would mention that out of each block of about 8 loos, only tow of each lot were proper sit-down toilets. The others were "holes in the floor" type.<br>All in all, a good stay except we wished that the pool was open all day. I think the life-guard had his siesta break during closure time. There is a restaurant a short walk up the road on the other side.]]></description>
